# About-myself
I'm deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I specialize in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex challenges. My recent thesis focused on AI-generated spam recognition, demonstrating my proficiency in NLP techniques and deploying LLM models effectively. I've gained practical experience through multiple Kaggle competitions, refining my skills in feature engineering, model optimization, and ensemble techniques. With a commitment to driving innovation through data-driven decision-making, I excel at interpreting complex datasets to derive actionable insights for business growth.
